Basically, my school bans powershell and cmd

So I made this simple program that makes you able to use CMD
(of couse as non-admin)

You can get admin though, with an MSI payload executed using the pySHELL

Will be implemented in the future

Also has a BREAKPOINT EXCEPTION thrower which could be used to terminate
monitoring softwares (NOT ADVISED TO USE)
